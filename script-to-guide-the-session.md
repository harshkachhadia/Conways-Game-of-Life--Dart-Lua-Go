## Introduction:
Thanks for being willing to participate in our experiment. Today we have three implementations of the Game of Life program, each with a simple. Your task is to correct the bug in each implementation as time allows. 

We have an implementation in go, Lua, and Dart. We will randomly choose a language for you to start with. We will cap the time for you to solve the bug in this language to 25 minutes. At the end, we will have a Google Form for you to fill out. If time allows, you will have the chance to try a different language.

## Letâ€™s Begin
### 1. Debug using online compiler
To debug using an online compiler, you can find the link for each language in the README.md files present in their respective directories.
### 2. Debug using your own computer
To begin, we will clone the repository from Github. Use the following command that I will paste in the Chat window.

```
git clone https://github.com/tirthpatel7498/Game-of-Life_510_HW-3
```

After cloning (it is advisable to create your separate branch for debugging purposes), cd into the <chosen language> directory and reference the `README.md` on how to build and run the program. Each `README.md` also contains basic instructions on how to add a debug statement to the console.

Feel free to ask you facilitator about any questions you might have.

## Feedback
Now that you have completed our experiment, please complete this self-survey about your thoughts using this language.
