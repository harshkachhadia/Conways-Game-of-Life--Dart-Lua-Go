Purpose:
This script is intended to be read by a facilitator of the session.


Introduction:
Thanks for being willing to participate in our experiment. Today we have three implementations of the Game of Life program, each with a simple. Your task is to correct the bug in each implementation as time allows. 
We have an implementation in go, Lua, and Dart. We will randomly choose a language for you to start with. We will cap the time for you to solve the bug in this language to 25 minutes. At the end, we will have a Google Form for you to fill out. If time allows, you will have the chance to try a different language.

Letâ€™s Begin

Your language to start with is <chosen language>. To begin, we will clone the repository from Github. Use the following command.

git clone https://github.com/tirthpatel7498/Game-of-Life_510_HW-3

After cloning (it is advisable to create your separate branch for debugging purposes), cd into the <chosen language> directory and reference the README on how to build and run the program. Each README also contains basic instructions on how to add a debug statement to the console.

How to run the code:
	For go, please refer to the README.md in the golang directory. 
	For dart, refer to the README.md file in the Dart directory.
	For Lua, refer to the README.md file in the Lua directory.

How to print debug statements:
	For go, please refer to the README.md in the golang directory.
