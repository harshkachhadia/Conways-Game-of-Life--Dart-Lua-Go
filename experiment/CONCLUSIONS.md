# Experiment Conclusions

Our data and visualizations can be seen at this Google Sheet. Some visualizations and summaries are provided inline below.

## Procedure

We studied 10 different participants across three different programming languages (Lua, Dart, and golang). Each particpant had 30 minutes to find bugs in a single implementation. We assigned each particpant a language to code in and observered their progress via Zoom screen sessions. In some cases we gave general hints, but stayed away from explicity mentioning where they were in the code. 

While we initially were expecting our participants to download our repository, we turned to [repl.it](https://repl.it) as our first experiments consumed too much time to download and setup their development environment.

## Results

## Conclusions

## Learnings

We had a handful of learnings from conducting this experiment

- **Use Tests to Help Participants Know They Have Fixed a Bug**

  Our participants had a hard time knowing if they had solved the bug. While we had tests in our repository, we should have written negative tests cases that were intentionally failing in a hosted coding environment like [repl.it](https://repl.it). This would have made it easier for participants to find logical errors in our implemenations. 

- **Start With a Hosted Coding Environment Like [repl.it](https://repl.it) First**

  If we would have used [repl.it](https://repl.it) to begin with, we could have made links to them, managing the bugs within them, etc. easier to manage.

- **Use Different Types of Bugs**

  We used only logical bugs instead of compilation bugs, mainly because we wanted our participants to use our repository. Something like [repl.it](https://repl.it) would have made this easier.
