## Introduction
Conway's Game of Life is a cellular automaton game. It is a zero-player game, meaning that its evolution is determined by its initial state, requiring no further input.

## Rules of Game

The game starts with a random initial population, which will further evolve on its own(requiring no further input) into new generation by following the rules mentioned below, and the process goes on either for infinity or becomes extinct after some generations.

     C   N                 new C
     1   0,1             ->  0  // Lonely
     1   4,5,6,7,8       ->  0  // Overcrowded
     1   2,3             ->  1  // Lives
     0   3               ->  1  // It takes three to give birth!
     0   0,1,2,4,5,6,7,8 ->  0  // Barren
